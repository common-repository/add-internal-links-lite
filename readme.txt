	b) Access your WordPress site's files using an FTP client, a file manager provided by your hosting control panel, or any other method you have available to access your site's files.
	c) Navigate to the wp-content/plugins/ directory within your WordPress installation.
	d) Create a new directory within the plugins directory and name it something descriptive, such as internal-links-plugin.
	e) Unzip the plugin and copy the files to the new file directory you just made. Ensure it uploads to your server.
	f) Now, go into your wordpress dashboard to your plugins and activate the plugin.
	g) Start interlinking! And don't forget to donate and feed my puppies.

== Usage ==
Here's how it works:

You'll find the plugin under the WordPress Settings menu.

Click on the plugin in the settings menu, and a user screen will appear where you can select (via dropdowns) either a single article or an article category target.

Next, you can select whether or not to include a link to your selected pillar post or page. If you choose Yes, select your preferred pillar post or page from the dropdown.

When you click the button to proceed, the plugin works as follows after selecting either a single article or a category.

a)The plugin will retrieve all the articles in the same category as either the single article you selected or the category you selected.
b)The plugin will randomly select 6 articles in the same category and create an HTML heading and list of linked titles. It then adds this list to either the end of the single article or performs the same action on all articles in the category selected.
c)If you selected Yes for pillar content, and you've selected the target post or page as the pillar, the plugin will proceed to add the title of your selected post or page as a bolded first item of the links list.
